# Pricing-Options
This is a project to calculate the prices of different derivative products

I plan to add some vanilla and exotic options (American/Bermudian/European - call/put options, Digital and double digital options, barrier options, Arithmetic and Geometric Asian options) as well as different methods to obtain their price (Monte Carlo, Black formulas -Scholes, Trees).

I'm am studying several books in financial mathematics and the objective of this project is simply to learn, practise the theory and gain more experience in C++.
